# Mission

At the end of the day, the goal is to **empower human expression, collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving** by augmenting human perception, intelligence, and learning.

## What this means for our engineering choices

### Optimize for human outcomes (not vibes)
- Faster iteration → more creative exploration.
- Clear specs + reproducible builds → better collaboration.
- Evidence-first evaluation → real learning, less placebo.

### Core product principles
- **Less is more:** prefer minimal code and minimal complexity.
- **Reuse proven patterns:** pull from established repos and official docs.
- **Measurable improvement:** use KPIs, eval harnesses, and A/B tests.
- **Safety + trust:** approvals/guardrails for high-risk actions.

### Practical workflow goals
- Enable **0→1** scaffolding for apps and features.
- Make systems **easy to maintain, easy to debug**, and legible to humans + AI.
- Compound over time: durable memory + feedback loops.
